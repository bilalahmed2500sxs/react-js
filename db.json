      "body": "To make it as a professional, you need to play First-class cricket. Most professional teams in Pakistan represent Pakistan companies (such as Habib Bank and Pakistan International Airlines) are known as 'departmental teams'. They play in a first class competition called Patrons Trophy. These are split into two grades.Cricket is considered the most popular sport in Pakistan. After the partition of India in 1947 and the formation of Pakistan, Pakistan played its first official match in 1952 under the captaincy of Abdul Kardar against India in 1952 registering their first Test victory in Lucknow.\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, had a great love for sport and fully realised the vital role it played in the development of nations and inculcation of discipline among the masses. In a meeting with the Organizing Committee of the First Pakistan Olympic Games held at Karachi, Jinnah said to the first President of the Pakistan Olympic Association Mr. Ahmed E.H.:\n\n\"Dedicate yourself to sports promotion, for when you and I are gone, leadership will go into the hands of Youth, and Youth is our wealth, a raw material, that must be hammered into shape, into burnished steel to strive and smite in defence – the defence of the integrity and solidarity of Pakistan – the defence of the ideology of Pakistan.\"\nThe first National Games were held at Polo Ground, Karachi from 23 to 25 April 1948. Sportsmen and officials from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and all the integrated Provincial units of West Pakistan took part in these games. The total number of athletes was 140. No competitors were, however, invited from any foreign country. Competitions were held in basketball, boxing, cycling, track and field, volleyball, weightlifting, and wrestling.\n\nOver the years, Pakistan has been held back due to the lack of funds placed in sports. Many facilities are substandard, causing Pakistan to fall behind other nations. In its early years the young state had been able to compete with much success, but during the late 1970s, with the government no longer investing in athletics, the country could no longer compete.\n\nHowever, since the late 1990s, this trend has changed. Money is now being placed into sports, and many of the federations are now managed by people who are trying to push Pakistani sportsmen and -women forward. International tournaments are now hosted in the country, and the nation sends athletes to compete abroad. There has also been restructuring of national tournaments, and new facilities and equipment are being provided. This has seen overall results improve.\n\nOn March 3, 2009, 12 militants with guns, grenades, and rocket launchers attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka national cricket team to a match at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan. Six Pakistani policemen escorting the team and two civilians were killed while seven Sri Lankan players and an assistant coach were injured. Since the terrorist attacks, no foreign cricket teams toured Pakistan until 2015 when Zimbabwe toured for an away series. A month after the attack on the Sri Lankan team, the International Cricket Council relieved Pakistan of co-hosting duty for any 2011 Cricket World Cup games. Pakistan has tried to make the best of the situation by offering to host its \"home\" matches on neutral territory in the United Arab Emirates.[2] However, due to a decrease in terrorism in Pakistan over the past few years, as well as an increase in security, many teams have toured Pakistan since 2015.[3] These teams include Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Bangladesh, South Africa, Australia and an ICC World XI team. In addition, the Pakistan Super League has seen games hosted in Pakistan.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\nThe Pakistan Sports Board is a government institution whereas the Pakistan Olympic Association is working under the shelter of the International Olympic Committee. Due to government interference, the Pakistan Olympic Association is very close to getting a ban from participation in Olympic Games. Due to cold war, Pakistani sport is also suffering but, there is no hope to resolve this problem due to government level dictatorship. [9]\n\n",

      "title": "T20 Cricket",
      "body": "The format was quickly adopted by other countries, and two years later Australia and New Zealand played each other in a lighthearted T20 match in Auckland, the first official international T20 match. Both sides wore uniforms from the 1980s and wore (mostly fake) moustaches. It quickly became apparent, though, that T20 had the potential to attract a new, vibrant, young audience to cricket. The first T20 World Cup, played in South Africa in 2007, was won by India, creating a huge market for T20 on the subcontinent that was quickly exploited by the IPL. Subsequent World Cups were played in various cricket-playing countries, with the West Indies capturing the most titles (two). Each major cricketing country developed its own domestic T20 tournaments, and a Champions League competition between the best club sides—like that contested in European football (soccer)—is held at the end of each T20 season.\n\nWith its cheerleaders, loud music, and quick-fire entertainment, T20 was credited with reviving cricket in the 21st century. After initial doubts, players began to master the new skills demanded by T20 and to improve their fielding, throwing, and fitness. Traditional cricket followers, however, feared that inevitably T20 would threaten the future of Test cricket, regarded as the purest and most intricate form of the ground.One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.",
